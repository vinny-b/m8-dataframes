# Exercise 2: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have scored in each game this season (google "Seahawks")
SeahawksScored <- c(12,3,37,27)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored against them in each game this season
SeahawksGotScored <- c(10,9,18,17)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
my.data <- data.frame(SeahawksScored,SeahawksGotScored)


# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
my.data$diff <- my.data$SeahawksScored - my.data$SeahawksGotScored

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom
my.data$won <- my.data$diff > 0

# Create a vector of the opponents
opponents <- c("Dolphins", "Rams", "49ers", "Jets")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
row.names(my.data) <- opponents
