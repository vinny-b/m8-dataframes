# Exercise 1: Lists


# Create a vector of everything you ate for breakfast
breakfast <- c("eggs","ham")

# Create a vector of everything you ate for lunch
lunch <- c("turkey", "bread")


# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch
meals <- list(lunch=lunch, breakfast=breakfast)


# Add a `dinner` index to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat for dinner
meals$dinner <- c("curry","rice")

# Extract your 'dinner' element from your list and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner <- meals[["dinner"]]

### Bonus ### 
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
items <- lapply(meals, length)

# Write a function that adds pizza to every meal
AddPizza <- function(x) {
  x <- c(x,"pizza")

}

# Add pizza to every meal!
better.meals <- lapply(meals, AddPizza)
